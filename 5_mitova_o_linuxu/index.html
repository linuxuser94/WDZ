      <h1>5 Myths about Linux!</h1>
      <list>
        <dl>
          <dt>Everything on Linux is done inside the terminal!</dt>
          <dd>
            Linux distributions of today come with desktop environments, meaning
            a user doesn't have to use the terminal if they don't want to. In
            fact there are themes for desktop environments that mimic Windows.
            <br /><br />
            However if interacting with themes and changing the layout of your
            desktop on your own seems scary! Many distributions come with KDE, a
            desktop environment that is often most compared to Windows. Whereas
            for Mac users they may find Gnome to be more similar to the
            environment they are used to.
            <br /><br />
            Linux even caters to weaker systems by providing lightweight desktop
            envrionments such as XFCE, LXDE, LXQt, MATE and others.
          </dd>

          <dt>Installing Linux is hard!</dt>
          <dd>
            This is simply not true. Gone are the times where installing Linux
            was an arcane feat in the workshops of IT wizards! <br /><br />
            In fact most Linux distributions feature an installer that has a
            GUI. While it's not similar to the Windows installer, the steps are
            the same. With the interface guiding you every step of the way.
            <br /><br />
            Partitioning is automated if you do not want to deal with it.
            <br /><br />
            The kernel is precompiled for you and any updates to it are first
            tested by the developer before being shipped to the end user.
            <br /><br />
            All necessary drivers come preinstalled, except in the case of
            Nvidia - but some distributions have made it easy even for Nvidia
            users. All necessary apps come preinstalled as a part of the
            distribution, and any apps you want may be found on the app store
            built into the operating system.
          </dd>

          <dt>Peripherals do not work on Linux!</dt>
          <dd>
            Support for such devices may vary from item to item. However! Most
            of them do in fact work on Linux! <br /><br />
            The only issue that users may encounter is actually configuring
            their devices which requires manufacturer drivers that usually run
            on Windows. But even so! The open source community has come up with
            solutions like Piper which support a broad range of devices. And
            solutions like OpenRazer which support, you guessed it.. a broad
            range of Razer products! Sometimes manufacturers have instructions
            on how to configure their devices on Linux.
            <br /><br />
            In case your device is not supported on Linux, any device that can
            be configured this way - usually has internal memory. Launching a
            virtual machine with Windows and configuring it that way will store
            the configuration into said memory. Which will then work on Linux.
          </dd>

          <dt>Linux lacks apps!</dt>
          <dd>
            The idea that Linux lacks apps is probably the biggest myth on this
            list. <br /><br />
            There is a reason professionals around the world use Linux for
            enhanced productivity and automatization.
            <br /><br />
            Linux usually has a replacement for any tool or app that other
            operating systems have. The MS Office suite is replaced by Libre
            Office or Open Office. For video editing purposes one has access to
            software like DaVinchi Resolve. Streaming and video recording is
            possible using OBS. Editing images can be accomplished in Krita and
            GIMP. 3D Modelling can be done in Blender which also supports Linux.
            One can even use WhatsApp on Linux. So this idea that Linux doesn't
            have apps is simply not true!
            <br /><br />
            Being chained to a specific tool or company that refuses to support
            Linux is not the fault of Linux, it's the fault of said company and
            the user.
            <br /><br />
          </dd>

          <dt>You can't game on Linux!</dt>
          <dd>
            While compatibility has been an issue in the past when it comes to
            playing video games on Linux, this is no longer the case.
            <br /><br />
            Advances in compatibility layers have made it so running games on
            Linux is much easier, with minimal configurations. Especially on
            platforms like Steam. These advances have made thousands of games
            compatible with Linux.
            <br /><br />
            In some cases, games actually perform better on Linux!
            <br /><br />
            Recent community tests have shown an increase of 10 FPS to 20 FPS
            while gaming on Linux when compared to Windows.
