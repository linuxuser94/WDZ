                <dt>Linux is not that hard!</dt>
                <dd>The biggest myth among users of other operating systems is that Linux is difficult to use.
                    <br><br> 
                    Linux is surrounded by ideas that you still have to compile your kernel. 
                    That you have to install and update everything through the terminal.
                    That somehow one single misclick will irrevocably damage your computer.
                    <br><br> 
                    None of these are true!
                    <br><br> 
                    Desktop Linux distributions of today have streamlined installers which come with all the necessary apps and drivers preconfigured ready to use out of the box!
                </dd>

                <dt>No forced updates!</dt>
                <dd>Mainstream operating systems, namely Windows runs updates without user input. Usually at inconvenient times. For long amounts of time!
                    These updates are usually very large in terms of disk space!
                    <br><br> 
                    On Linux you decide when it is convinient for you to update your system, if at all! But more importantly, even during such an update, 
                    you can carry on using your system!
