        <h1>5 Myths about Linux!</h1>
        <list>
            <dl>
                <dt>Everything on Linux is done inside the terminal!</dt>
                <dd>Linux distributions of today come with desktop environments, meaning a user doesn't have to use the terminal if they don't want to.
                    In fact there are themes for desktop environments that mimic Windows.
                    <br><br>
                    However if interacting with themes and changing the layout of your desktop on your own seems scary! 
                    Many distributions come with KDE, a desktop environment that is often most compared to Windows.
                    Whereas for Mac users they may find Gnome to be more similar to the environment they are used to.
                    <br><br>
                    Linux even caters to weaker systems by providing lightweight desktop envrionments such as XFCE, LXDE, LXQt, MATE and others.

                <dt>Installing Linux is hard!</dt>
                <dd>This is simply not true. Gone are the times where installing Linux was an arcane feat in the workshops of IT wizards!
                    <br><br>
                    In fact most Linux distributions feature an installer that has a GUI. While it's not similar to the Windows installer, the steps are the same.
                    With the interface guiding you every step of the way.
                    <br><br>
                    Partitioning is automated if you do not want to deal with it.
                    <br><br>
                    The kernel is precompiled for you and any updates to it are first tested by the developer before being shipped to the end user.
                    <br><br>
                    All necessary drivers come preinstalled, except in the case of Nvidia - but some distributions have made it easy even for Nvidia users.
                    All necessary apps come preinstalled as a part of the distribution, and any apps you want may be found on the app store built into the operating system.
                </dd>

                <dt>Linux lacks apps!</dt>
                <dd>The idea that Linux lacks apps is probably the biggest myth on this list.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a reason professionals around the world use Linux for enhanced productivity and automatization.
                    <br><br>
                    Linux usually has a replacement for any tool or app that other operating systems have. The MS Office suite is replaced by Libre Office or Open Office. 
                    For video editing purposes one has access to software like DaVinchi Resolve. Streaming and video recording is possible using OBS. 
                    Editing images can be accomplished in Krita and GIMP. 3D Modelling can be done in Blender which also supports Linux. One can even use WhatsApp on Linux.
                    So this idea that Linux doesn't have apps is simply not true!
                    <br><br>
                    Being chained to a specific tool or company that refuses to support Linux is not the fault of Linux, it's the fault of said company and the user.

                <dt>You can't game on Linux!</dt>
                <dd>While compatibility has been an issue in the past when it comes to playing video games on Linux, this is no longer the case.
                    <br><br>
                    Advances in compatibility layers have made it so running games on Linux is much easier, with minimal configurations. Especially on platforms like Steam.
                    These advances have made thousands of games compatible with Linux.
                    <br><br>
                    In some cases, games actually perform better on Linux! 
                    <br><br>
                    Recent community tests have shown an increase of 10 FPS to 20 FPS while gaming on Linux when compared to Windows.
